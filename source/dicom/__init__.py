Quick Start
-----------
1. A simple program to read a dicom file, modify a value, and write to a new file::
    import dicom
    dataset = dicom.read_file("file1.dcm")
    dataset.PatientName = 'anonymous'
    dataset.save_as("file2.dcm")

2. See the files in the examples directory that came with this package for more
examples, including some interactive sessions.

3. Learn the methods of the Dataset class; that is the one you will
work with most directly.

4. Questions/comments etc can be directed to the pydicom google group at
http://groups.google.com/group/pydicom
