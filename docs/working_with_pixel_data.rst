Introduction
============

pydicom tends to be "lazy" in interpreting DICOM data. For example, 
by default it doesn't do anything with pixel data 
except read in the raw bytes::

    >>> import pydicom
    >>> ds=pydicom.read_file("MR_small.dcm")
    >>> ds.PixelData
    '\x89\x03\xfb\x03\xcb\x04\xeb\x04\xf9\x02\x94\x01\x7f ...
    ...

``PixelData`` contains the raw bytes exactly as found in the file. 
If the image is JPEG compressed, these bytes will be the compressed 
pixel data, not the expanded, uncompressed image. Whether the image is 
e.g. 16-bit or 8-bit, multiple frames or not, ``PixelData`` contains the same 
raw bytes. But there is a function that can shape the pixels more sensibly 
if you need to work with them...

pixel_array
===========

.. warning::
    To work with the pixel_array property `NumPy <http://numpy.org/>`_
    must be installed on your system.

A property of Dataset called ``pixel_array`` provides more useful pixel data
for uncompressed images. The ``pixel_array`` property returns a NumPy array::

    >>> import dicom
    >>> ds=pydicom.read_file("MR_small.dcm")
    >>> ds.pixel_array
    array([[ 905, 1019, 1227, ...,  302,  304,  328],
           [ 628,  770,  907, ...,  298,  331,  355],
           [ 498,  566,  706, ...,  280,  285,  320],
           ...,
           [ 334,  400,  431, ..., 1094, 1068, 1083],
           [ 339,  377,  413, ..., 1318, 1346, 1336],
           [ 378,  374,  422, ..., 1369, 1129,  862]], dtype=int16)
    >>> ds.pixel_array.shape
    (64, 64)

NumPy can be used to modify the pixels, but if the changes are to be saved, 
they must be written back to the ``PixelData`` attribute::

    >>> for n,val in enumerate(ds.pixel_array.flat): # example: zero anything < 300
    ...     if val < 300:
    ...         ds.pixel_array.flat[n]=0
    >>> ds.PixelData = ds.pixel_array.tostring()
    >>> ds.save_as("newfilename.dcm")

Some changes may require other DICOM tags to be modified. For example, 
if the pixel data is reduced (e.g. a 512x512 image is collapsed to 256x256)
then ``ds.Rows`` and ``ds.Columns`` should be set appropriately.
You must explicitly set these yourself; pydicom does not do so automatically.

``pixel_array`` can also be used to pass image data to graphics libraries
for viewing. See :doc:`viewing_images` for details.
