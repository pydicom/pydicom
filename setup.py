    pydicom is a pure python package for parsing DICOM files.
    DICOM is a standard (http://medical.nema.org) for communicating
    medical images and related information such as reports
    and radiotherapy objects.

    pydicom makes it easy to read these complex files into natural
    pythonic structures for easy manipulation.
    Modified datasets can be written again to DICOM format files.
    See the `Getting Started <http://pydicom.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_
    page for installation and basic information, and the
    `Pydicom User Guide <http://pydicom.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pydicom_user_guide.html>`_ page
    for an overview of how to use the pydicom library.
