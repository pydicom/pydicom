      # Note: in docs at https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish,
      #  it is suggested to publish in its own job, using 'needs' to
      #  ensure previous job succeeded, and artifact upload/download of
      #  the dist folder.  That seems to be related mainly to multi-OS builds,
      #  so done in same job here.
