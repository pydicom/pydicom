3.1.0
=====

Changes
-------

* DICOM dictionary updated to 2024d.
* Prefer using pylibjpeg over GDCM when encoding *RLE Lossless*.
* Prefer using Pillow when decoding *JPEG Baseline 8-bit* and *JPEG Extended 12-bit*
* Improvements made to communications with the plugins when decoding and encoding pixel
  data and correcting for inter-frame decoding variations in multi-frame datasets (:pr:`2262`).
* The metadata returned by :meth:`Decoder.as_buffer
  <pydicom.pixels.decoders.base.Decoder.as_buffer>` is now a ``dict`` containing the
  per-frame metadata to help account for inter-frame variations in frame properties
  when decoding.

Fixes
-----

* Changed logging of missing plugin imports to use :attr:`logging.DEBUG` (:issue:`2128`).
* Include all :mod:`~pydicom.examples` module datasets with the package (:issue:`2128`, :issue:`2131`).
* Fixed an invalid VR value in the private data dictionary (:issue:`2132`).
* Fixed checking for *Bits Stored* when converting *Float Pixel Data* and *Double Float
  Pixel Data* using the :mod:`~pydicom.pixels` backend (:issue:`2135`).
* Fixed decoding of pixel data for images with *Bits Allocated* of 1 when frame boundaries
  are not aligned with byte boundaries (:issue:`2134`).
* Fixed a number of issues with decoding pixel data on big endian systems such as s390x
  (:issue:`2147`).
* Fixed being unable to pickle datasets containing LUT descriptor elements such as
  *LUT Descriptor* and *Red Palette Color LUT Descriptor* (:issue:`2160`).
* Fixed :meth:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset.decompress` and :meth:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset.compress`
  changing the *SOP Instance UID* when not required (:issue:`2171`).
* Make sure the value of multi-valued tags is always returned as an instance of
  :class:`~pydicom.multival.MultiValue`.
* Make sure that no download of examples is attempted on importing examples if the example
  data is not found locally (:issue:`2223`).
* Add mitigation and better error messaging for SWIG errors when using GDCM to decompress
  datasets with more than 2**31 - 1 bytes (:issue:`2227`).
* Use the setting :attr:`~pydicom.config.settings.writing_validation_mode` also for writing
  values with VRs supporting only ASCII characters (:issue:`2243`).
* Correctly handle empty values represented as empty strings in json while converting them
  to a dataset (:issue:`2221`).
* Correctly handle empty LUT data (:issue:`2238`).

Enhancements
------------
* Python 3.12 and 3.13 now supported; limited support for pre-release Python 3.14
* Added the option to pass a ``bool`` ndarray to :func:`~pydicom.pixels.set_pixel_data`
  to store with *Bits Allocated* of ``1`` using bit-packing (:issue:`2141`).
* Added a check to :meth:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset.set_pixel_data` to ensure that the
  pixel data length doesn't exceed the allowed maximum.
* Added the :attr:`Dataset.is_decompressed<pydicom.dataset.Dataset.is_decompressed>`
  convenience property for determining whether a dataset uses a compressed transfer
  syntax or not (:issue:`2155`).
* Updated UIDs to version 2024d of the DICOM Standard
* The following UID constants have been added:

  * :attr:`~pydicom.uid.JPEGXLLossless`
  * :attr:`~pydicom.uid.JPEGXLJPEGRecompression`
  * :attr:`~pydicom.uid.JPEGXL`
  * :attr:`~pydicom.uid.DeflatedImageFrameCompression`
* Added ability to specify tag numbers in the CLI commands (allows private tags to be specified)
* Removed `exec` and `eval` from tests, CLI, and scripts for improved security (:issue:`2193`)
* Added support for up to 16-bit input images to :func:`~pydicom.pixels.convert_color_space`
* Added support for ``YBR_PARTIAL_420`` and ``YBR_PARTIAL_422`` to
  :func:`~pydicom.pixels.convert_color_space` (:issue:`2210`)
* Added support for compressing and decompressing *Deflated Image Frame Compression* (:issue:`2213`)
* Suggest an element keyword when an unknown camel case dataset attribute is used.
* Added enhanced exception notes (Python >= 3.11) giving a pseudo-code path to the DICOM object
  where an error occurred.  Activated using `with dataset:` context; already used internally in key
  locations (:issue:`2168`)
* Added support for adding unknown public transfer syntaxes to :func:`~pydicom.uid.register_transfer_syntax`
* When decoding JPEG pixel data use Pillow's color transformations rather than
  :func:`~pydicom.pixels.convert_color_space` where applicable (:issue:`2228`)
* Take the color space information from an Adobe APP14 marker into account when decoding
  pixel data for JPEG transfer syntaxes.
