Version 3.0.0
=================================

Changes
-------
* Removed support for Python <= 3.9
* compat module removed
* values with VR AE with an incorrect value length are now handled
  gracefully (extra bytes are ignored with a warning)
* a value of 0 for ``NumberOfFrames`` is now handled as 1 frame, with a user warning issued
  on reading the pixel data (:issue:`1844`)
* The `dicomdir` module and `DicomDir` class have been removed and reading a
  DICOMDIR dataset now returns a normal :class:`~pydicom.dataset.FileDataset` instance.
  For handling DICOM File-sets and DICOMDIR datasets use the 
  :class:`~pydicom.fileset.FileSet` class instead.

Enhancements
------------
* Added details of missing required tag information when adding Dataset to Fileset

Fixes
-----
* Fixed the GDCM and pylibjpeg handlers changing the *Pixel Representation* value to 0
  when the J2K stream disagrees with the dataset and
  :attr:`~pydicom.config.APPLY_J2K_CORRECTIONS` is `True` (:issue:`1689`)

Pydicom Internals
-----------------
* repository folder structure refactored
* renamed top level "source" folder to "util"
* New CI tools - `dependabot`, and `pre-commit` using black and ruff
