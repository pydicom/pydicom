Version 2.1.0
=================================

Changelog
-------
* Dropped support for Python 3.5 (only Python 3.6+ supported)

Enhancements
............
* Large testing data is no longer distributed within the pydicom package
  with the aim to reduce the package download size. These test files
  will download on-the-fly whenever either the tests are run, or should
  the file(s) be requested via the data manager functions.
  For example:

  * to download all files and get their paths on disk you can run
    ``pydicom.data.get_testdata_files()``. 

  * To download the 7.2 MB file ``RG1_UNCI.dcm`` and get its path on disk 
    you can run ``pydicom.data.get_testdata_file("RG1_UNCI.dcm")``
