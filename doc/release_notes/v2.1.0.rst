Version 2.1.0
=================================

Changelog
---------
* Dropped support for Python 3.5 (only Python 3.6+ supported)

Enhancements
............
* Large testing data is no longer distributed within the pydicom package
  with the aim to reduce the package download size. These test files
  will download on-the-fly whenever either the tests are run, or should
  the file(s) be requested via the data manager functions.
  For example:

  * to download all files and get their paths on disk you can run
    ``pydicom.data.get_testdata_files()``.

  * To download the 7.2 MB file ``RG1_UNCI.dcm`` and get its path on disk
    you can run ``pydicom.data.get_testdata_file("RG1_UNCI.dcm")``
* Added a new pixel data handler based on pylibjpeg which supports all
  (non-retired) JPEG transfer syntaxes (:issue:`1127`)

Fixes
.....
* ``Dataset.copy`` now works as expected (see :issue:`1146`)

* Optimistically parse undefined length non-SQ data as if it's encapsulated
  pixel data to avoid erroring out on embedded sequence delimiter
  (:issue:`1140`)
