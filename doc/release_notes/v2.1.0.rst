Version 2.1.0
=================================

Changelog
---------
* Dropped support for Python 3.5 (only Python 3.6+ supported)

Enhancements
............
* Large testing data is no longer distributed within the pydicom package
  with the aim to reduce the package download size. These test files
  will download on-the-fly whenever either the tests are run, or should
  the file(s) be requested via the data manager functions.
  For example:

  * To download all files and get their paths on disk you can run
    :func:`pydicom.data.get_testdata_files`.
  * To download an individual file and get its path on disk you can use
    :func:`pydicom.data.get_testdata_file`, e.g. for ``RG1_UNCI.dcm`` use
    ``pydicom.data.get_testdata_file("RG1_UNCI.dcm")``
* Added a new pixel data handler based on pylibjpeg which supports all
  (non-retired) JPEG transfer syntaxes (:issue:`1127`)
* Added handler for *Waveform Data* and :meth:`Dataset.waveform_generator
  <pydicom.dataset.Dataset.waveform_generator>` which returns a generator
  object that yields an :class:`~numpy.ndarray` for each multiplex group in
  a *Waveform Sequence*.

Changes
.......
* Reading and adding unknown non-private tags now does not raise an exception
  per default, only when `config.enforce_valid_values` is set (:issue:`1161`)

Fixes
.....
* ``Dataset.copy`` now works as expected (see :issue:`1146`)

* Optimistically parse undefined length non-SQ data as if it's encapsulated
  pixel data to avoid erroring out on embedded sequence delimiter
  (:issue:`1140`)
