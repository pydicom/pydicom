Version 2.2.0
=================================

Changelog
---------
* Data elements with a VR of **AT** must now be set with values
  acceptable to :func:`~pydicom.tag.Tag`, and are always stored as a
  :class:`~pydicom.tag.BaseTag`.  Previously, any Python type could be
  set.

Enhancements
............
* Added a command-line interface for pydicom.  Current subcommands are:
    * ``show``: display all or part of a DICOM file
    * ``codify`` to produce Python code for writing files or sequence items
      from scratch.

  Please see the :ref:`cli_guide` for examples and details
  of all the options for each command.
* A field containing an invalid number of bytes will result in a warning
  instead of an exception when
  :attr:`~pydicom.config.convert_wrong_length_to_UN` is set to True.
* Private tags known via the private dictionary will now get the configured
  VR if read from a dataset instead of "UN" (:issue:`1051`).
* while reading explicit VR, a switch to implicit VR will be silently attempted
  if the VR bytes are not valid VR characters, and config option
  :attr:`~pydicom.config.assume_implicit_vr_switch` is ``True`` (default)
* New functionality to help with correct formatting of decimal strings (DS)
    * Added :func:`~pydicom.valuerep.is_valid_ds` to check whether a string is
      valid as a DICOM decimal string (DS) and
      :func:`~pydicom.valuerep.format_number_as_ds` to format a given ``float``
      or ``Decimal`` as a DS while retaining the highest possible level of
      precision
    * If :attr:`~pydicom.config.enforce_valid_values` is set to ``True``, all
      DS objects created will be checked for the validity of their string
      representations.
    * Added optional ``auto_format`` parameter to the init methods of
      :class:`~pydicom.valuerep.DSfloat` and
      :class:`~pydicom.valuerep.DSdecimal` and the :func:`~pydicom.valuerep.DS`
      factory function to allow explicitly requesting automatic formatting of
      the string representations of these objects when they are constructed.
* Added methods to construct :class:`~pydicom.valuerep.PersonName` objects
  from individual components of names (``family_name``, ``given_name``, etc.).
  See :meth:`~pydicom.valuerep.PersonName.from_named_components` and
  :meth:`~pydicom.valuerep.PersonName.from_named_components_veterinary`.
* Added library support so that files can be downloaded
  not only through ``urllib.request`` but also through the ``requests`` package.
  If you run into problems using ``urllib.request``,
  a more powerful ``requests`` package will be recommended via log messages.


Changes
.......
* Changed the raising exception to return False
  in :meth:`~pydicom.tag.BaseTag.__eq__`,
  when operand cannot be converted to BaseTag Type (:pr:`1327`)

Fixes
.....
* Fixed pickling a :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` instance with sequences
  after the sequence had been read (:issue:`1278`)
* Fixed JSON export of numeric values
* Fixed handling of sequences of unknown length that switch to implicit
  encoding, and sequences with VR ``UN`` (:issue:`1312`)
