Version 2.2.0
=================================

Changelog
---------
* Data elements with a VR of **AT** must now be set with values
  acceptable to :func:`~pydicom.tag.Tag`, and are always stored as a
  :class:`~pydicom.tag.BaseTag`.  Previously, any Python type could be
  set.

Enhancements
............
* Added a command-line interface for pydicom.  Current subcommands are:
    * ``show``: display all or part of a DICOM file
    * ``codify`` to produce Python code for writing files or sequence items
      from scratch.
  Please see the :ref:`cli_guide` for examples and details
  of all the options for each command.
* A field containing an invalid number of bytes will result in a warning
  instead of an exception when
  :attr:`~pydicom.config.convert_wrong_length_to_UN` is set to True.
* Private tags known via the private dictionary will now get the configured
  VR if read from a dataset instead of "UN" (:issue:`1051`).

Fixes
.....
* Fixed pickling a :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` instance with sequences
  after the sequence had been read (:issue:`1278`)
* Fixed JSON export of numeric values
