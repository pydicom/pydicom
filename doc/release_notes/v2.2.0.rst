Enhancements

* Added a command-line interface for pydicom.  Current subcommands are:

    * ``codify`` to produce Python code for writing files or sequence items
      from scratch.
  Please see the :ref:`cli_guide` for examples and details
  of all the options for each command.
* A field containing an invalid number of bytes will result in a warning 
  instead of an exception when 
  :attr:`~pydicom.config.convert_wrong_length_to_UN` is set to True.
