Version 1.2.0
=================================

Changelog
---------

Changes
.......

* PIL removed as a fallback if Pillow is not available in the pillow pixel data
  handler (:issue:`722`)
* ``uid.JPEGBaseLineLossy8bit`` deprecated and will be removed in v1.3. Use
  ``uid.JPEGBaseline`` instead. (:issue:`726`)
* ``uid.JPEGBaseLineLossy12bit`` deprecated and will be removed in v1.3. Use
  ``uid.JPEGExtended`` instead. (:issue:`726`)
* ``uid.JPEG2000Lossy`` deprecated and will be removed in v1.3. Use
  ``uid.JPEG2000`` instead. (:issue:`726`)
* ``config.image_handlers`` deprecated and will be removed in v1.3. use
  ``config.pixel_data_handlers`` instead. There is also a change in behaviour
  in that ``image_handlers`` previously used to only contain the pixel data
  handlers that had their dependencies met. ``pixel_data_handlers`` contains
  all handlers no matter whether or not their dependencies are met. To check
  if a handler is available for use (it both supports the transfer syntax and
  has its dependency met) then use the handler's ``is_available`` method.
* ``DeferredDataElement`` class deprecated and will be removed in v1.3
    (:issue:`291`)


Enhancements
............

* Added possibility to set byte strings as value for VRs that use only the
  default character set (:issue:`624`)
* Functions for encapsulating frames added to encaps module (:pull_request:`696`)
* Added ``Dataset.fix_meta_info()`` (:issue:`584`)
* Add new function for bit packing ``pack_bits`` for use with BitsAllocated
  = 1 (:pull_request:`715`)
* Added handling of single-byte character set extensions (:pull_request:`718`)
* Added ``uid.JPEGLosslessP14`` for UID 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57
* Added ``uid.JPEG2000MultiComponentLossless`` for UID 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.92
* Added ``uid.JPEG2000MultiComponent`` for UID 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.93
* Added full support for Planar Configuration (:issue:`713`)
* Added support for single frame pixel data where BitsAllocated >8 and
  SamplesPerPixel > 1 (:issue:`713`)
* Small improvement in RLE decoding speed (~10%).
* Add support for non-conformant RLE segment ordering (:pull_request:`729`)


Fixes
.....

* Removed unused ``original_string`` attribute from the ``DataElement`` class
  (:pull_request:`660`)
* Improve performance for Python 3 when dealing with compressed multi-frame
  Pixel Data with pillow and jpeg-ls (:issue:`682`).
* Improve performance of bit unpacking for non-PyPy2 interpreters
  (:pull_request:`715`)
