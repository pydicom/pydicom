Version 1.1.0
=================================

Changelog
---------

Minor changes
.............

* ``UID.__str__`` no longer returns the UID name (when known). The UID name is
  still available using the ``UID.name`` property.
* ``UID`` equality comparisons now return ``False`` when performing the
  equivalent of ``UID == UID.name``.
* ``Dataset`` equality now only compares the dataset's ``DataElements`` (#464).

Fixes
.....

* ``UID`` should behave as expected for a python ``str`` subclass (#256).
* group length elements in groups above 0x0006 removed on writing (#32).
* fixed ``write_PN`` raising a ``TypeError`` when called with a non-iterable
  encoding parameter (#489).
* fixed ``Dataset`` not slicing correctly when an (0xFFFF,0xFFFF) element is
  present (#92).
