Version 1.1.0
=================================

Changelog
---------

Minor changes
.............

* ``UID.__str__`` no longer returns the UID name (when known). The UID name is
  still available using the ``UID.name`` property.
* ``Dataset`` equality now only compares the dataset's ``DataElements`` (#464).

Fixes
.....

* ``UID`` should behave as expected for a python ``str`` subclass (#256).
* group length elements in groups above 0x0006 removed on writing (#32).
* fixed ``write_PN`` raising a ``TypeError`` when called with a non-iterable
  encoding parameter (#489).
* fixed ``Dataset`` not slicing correctly when an (0xFFFF,0xFFFF) element is
  present (#92).

Other
-----

* A deprecation warning has been added for UID.__eq__ and UID.__ne__ when
  comparing ``UID == [UID name]`` and ``UID != [UID name]``. Starting in v1.2,
  ``UID`` equality and inequality comparisons will return ``False`` when
  performing the equivalent of ``UID == [UID name]`` and ``UID != [UID name]``,
  respectively. E.g. UID('1.2.840.10008.1.1') == 'Verification SOP Class' will
  return False. Use ``UID.name == [UID name]`` instead.
