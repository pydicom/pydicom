.. rubric:: How to use other packages with pydicom to view DICOM images

Introduction
============

pydicom is mainly concerned with getting at the DICOM data elements in files,
but it is often desirable to view pixel data as an image.
There are several options:

  * Use any of the many `DICOM viewer
    <http://www.dclunie.com/medical-image-faq/html/part8.html#DICOMFileConvertorsAndViewers>`_
    programs available
  * use pydicom with `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
  * use pydicom with python's stdlib `Tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/tkinter.html>`_ module.
  * use pydicom with the `Python Imaging Library (PIL)
    <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_
  * use pydicom with `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org/>`_

Using pydicom with matplotlib
=============================

matplotlib is available at http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/. It
can take 2-d image information from ``Dataset.pixel_array`` and display it.
Here is an example::

    >>> import pydicom
    >>> import pylab
    >>> ds=pydicom.read_file("CT_small.dcm")
    >>> pylab.imshow(ds.pixel_array, cmap=pylab.cm.bone)
    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0x0162A530>
    >>> pylab.show()
    >>>

Thanks to Roy Keyes for pointing out how to do this.


Using pydicom with Tkinter
==========================

The program `pydicom_Tkinter.py
<https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom/blob/master/viewers/pydicom_Tkinter.py>`_
in the ``contrib-pydicom`` repository demonstrates how to show an image using the
Tkinter graphics system, which comes standard with most python installs.
It creates a Tkinter PhotoImage in a Label widget or a user-supplied widget.


Using pydicom with Python Imaging Library (PIL)
===============================================

The module `pydicom_PIL.py
<https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom/blob/master/viewers/pydicom_PIL.py>`_
in the ``contrib-pydicom`` repository
uses PIL's ``Image.show()`` method after creating an Image instance
from the pixel data and some basic information about it (bit depth, LUTs, etc)


Using pydicom with wxPython
===========================

The module `imViewer-Simple.py
<https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom/blob/master/viewers/imViewer_Simple.py>`_
in the ``contrib`` folder uses wxPython (also PIL, but it notes that it
may not be strictly necessary) to display an image from a pydicom dataset.
